# test-technique

***IMPORTANT***
I did the part 1,2 and 3 of the test, I couldn't finish this test on time.

***Front end ***
For this part I used react js, next js for the routing and the useContext for storing global data and to simplify the use of the data. It would be better if I used redux (for more organisation ) but it would consume from me more time.

I used tailwinds for the css, all of it was from scratch so it's not responsive yet. I think, I should have used a real template  to save my time and do the other parts.

For the architecture of my repo, I did not use a specified one. I tried to make it simple withe  pages and components.


***Back end***

I used node js and express js for this part. I did not use an ORM but used mysql for the database. I opted for this database because for the part : creating the "bon de commande", we will need to have some intertaction and relationship between the data of the database. And mysql make it more easier withe the table concept.
